# Changelog

All notable changes to the software code (but not to the contents) of this
repository will be documented in the present file.
The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
Moreover, the project adheres to (Gregorian and UTC)
[Calendar Versioning](https://calver.org/overview.html),
with short year `YY` (23..99), short month `MM` (1..12), and short day `DD`
(1..31).
The generic scheme for subtitles is therefore `## [YY.MM.DD] - YYYY-0M-0D`,
where `YYYY` stands for full year (2023..9999), `0M` for zero-padded month
(01..12), and `0D` for zero-padded day (01..31).

## [23.5.3] - 2023-05-03

## [23.4.28] - 2023-04-28
