# sctypo

This repository contains the (software code and contents) sources of
[Christian Scheen](https://github.com/cscheen)’s
[professional website](http://sctypo.com/).
It is a website powered by the
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
static site generator (SSG), with the
[Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
CSS framework.
The software code of the website is released under the
[MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)
license (from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology); it owes a great
deal to
[Janne Kemppainen](https://pakstech.com/)’s
series of
[blog posts](https://pakstech.com/series/blog-with-hugo/)
written about Hugo.
The contents of the website, on the other hand, is published under the
[CC&nbsp;BY-SA&nbsp;4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
license (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike&nbsp;4.0 International).

The software code is intended for a specific website.
As such, it is unlikely to be suitable for other projects; possible bug
reports or pull requests will therefore remain politely (i.e., silently)
unanswered.
If the layout suits your needs, then please feel free to fork the
repository.
